Hi, I'm Nghia, a passionate game developer - game designer lived in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Shortly after graduated from [AUT](https://www.aut.ac.nz/), I joined [Glass Egg](https://www.glassegg.com/2d-3d-art-outsourcing-studio/) as a quality-oriented Technical Artist for over 3 years. At Glass Egg, I participated in cross production team to develop & manage tools, pipelines and workflow for productivity and efficiency.

Presently, I'm deepening and working as a Game Developer with various interesting projects daily.

<!-- Experienced Technical Manager with a demonstrated history of working in the computer games industry. Skilled in MEL, C#, Research and Development (R&D), Maya, and Programming.
